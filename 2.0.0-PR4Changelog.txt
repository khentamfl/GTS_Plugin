-Wasting Stamina to protect from size-related damage is player exclusive now.

-GTS now receives bounty and makes others hostile when doing crime of eating someone alive in front of everyone for example, in some cases at least

-Fixed follower animations triggering on Male actors, Male actors aren't able to use size actions on their own. For now.
-Improved weapon knockback when size difference is > than x12.0 between actors, now pushes actors forward instead of side-ways
-Fixed IsFemale() check inside the .dll working incorrectly (was always true), males should no longer use female anims (or use them at all)
-Grabbing: fixed player holding nothing in the left hand if save was done while holding someone, we now cancel this animation on save-reload
-Fixed some GTS animations not being played properly from the first attempt (Should no longer have animation cancels)  [ Credits to NickNak ]
-Fixed disappearing crush audio during weapon overkill (Overkill is when enemy explodes after weapon hit because of too massive damage and size difference)
-Fixed actors never respawning again, but at the cost of using scripts to deal with actors. Naked bodies may appear if you crush too many at once (and then disappear)
