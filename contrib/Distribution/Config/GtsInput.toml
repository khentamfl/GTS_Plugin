# Keyboard event map

# without the DIK_ prefix
#
# Mouse is LMB or RMB
#
# Events are specicified like this:
# ```toml
# [[InputEvent]]
# name = "SomeKeyEvent"
# keys = [ "A", "B", "LMB" ]
# exclusive = false
# duration = 0.0
# trigger = "once"
# ```
#
# - name: Is the event name. This determines what is done when these keys are
#         pressed. More that one `[[InputEvent]]` can trigger the same event name
#         which means you can have multiple keys combinations do that same thing
#         if you repeat the name
# - keys: Is a comma seperated list [] of keys names that will trigger the event
# - exclusive: When true means ONLY these keys must be pressed for the entire duration
#             when false other keys may be pressed and the event will still fire
# - duration: The length of time the keys must be pressed for before they fire
# - trigger: Either "once or "continuous". If "once" the keys must be released
#            before the event will fire again. If "continuous" the event will
#            fire every frame until the keys are released
