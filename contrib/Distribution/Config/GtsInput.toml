# Keyboard event map

# Key names are from directinput
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee418641(v=vs.85)
# without the DIK_ prefix
#
# Mouse is LMB or RMB
#
# Events are specicified like this:
# ```toml
# [[InputEvent]]
# name = "SomeKeyEvent"
# keys = [ "A", "B", "LMB" ]
# exclusive = false
# duration = 0.0
# trigger = "once"
# ```
# - Small Guide:
#
# - name: Is the event name. This determines what is done when these keys are
#         pressed. More that one `[[InputEvent]]` can trigger the same event name
#         which means you can have multiple keys combinations do that same thing, if you repeat the name at least.
#
# - keys: Is a comma seperated list [] of keys names that will trigger the event
#
# - exclusive: When true means ONLY these keys must be pressed for the entire duration
#              When false - other keys may be pressed and the event will still fire
#
# - duration: The length of time the keys must be pressed for before they fire
#
# - trigger: Either 
#            - "once" , "continuous" or "release". 
#            - "once" - the keys must be released before the event will fire again.
#            - "continuous" - the event will fire every frame until the keys are released
#            - "release" - event will be sent once you release the keys
#
# If you will forget to put , between "key" "key" - controls will break and input won't work.
# If for some reason input doesn't work - the mod will send in-game error that will let you know that you messed up in the config somewhere.
# In that case, triple check everything. High chance that you forgot comma or , somewhere.
#
# Correct: keys = ["Key","Key"]. INCORRECT: keys = ["Key""Key"]
